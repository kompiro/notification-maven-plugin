   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br/>

<br/>
   1. Definitions.
<br/>

<br/>
 &quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br/>
 and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br/>

<br/>
 &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br/>
 the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br/>

<br/>
 &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br/>
 other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br/>
 control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br/>
 &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br/>
 direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br/>
 otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br/>
 outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br/>

<br/>
 &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br/>
 exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br/>

<br/>
 &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br/>
 including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br/>
 source, and configuration files.
<br/>

<br/>
 &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br/>
 transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br/>
 not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br/>
 and conversions to other media types.
<br/>

<br/>
 &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br/>
 Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br/>
 copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br/>
 (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br/>

<br/>
 &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br/>
 form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br/>
 editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br/>
 represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br/>
 of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br/>
 separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br/>
 the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br/>

<br/>
 &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br/>
 the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br/>
 to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br/>
 submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br/>
 or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br/>
 the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
<br/>
 means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br/>
 to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br/>
 communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br/>
 and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br/>
 Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br/>
 excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br/>
 designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;
<br/>

<br/>
 &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br/>
 on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br/>
 subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br/>

<br/>
 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br/>
 this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br/>
 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br/>
 copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br/>
 publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br/>
 Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br/>

<br/>
 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br/>
 this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br/>
 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br/>
 (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br/>
 use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br/>
 where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br/>
 by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br/>
 Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br/>
 with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br/>
 institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br/>
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br/>
 or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br/>
 or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br/>
 granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br/>
 as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br/>

<br/>
 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br/>
 Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br/>
 modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br/>
 meet the following conditions:
<br/>

<br/>
 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br/>
 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br/>

<br/>
 (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br/>
 stating that You changed the files; and
<br/>

<br/>
 (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br/>
 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br/>
 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br/>
 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br/>
 the Derivative Works; and
<br/>

<br/>
 (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
<br/>
 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br/>
 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br/>
 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br/>
 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br/>
 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br/>
 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br/>
 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br/>
 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br/>
 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br/>
 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br/>
 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br/>
 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br/>
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br/>
 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br/>
 as modifying the License.
<br/>

<br/>
 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br/>
 may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br/>
 for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br/>
 for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br/>
 reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br/>
 the conditions stated in this License.
<br/>

<br/>
 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br/>
 any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br/>
 by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br/>
 this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br/>
 Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br/>
 the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br/>
 with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br/>

<br/>
 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br/>
 names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br/>
 except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br/>
 origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br/>

<br/>
 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br/>
 agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br/>
 Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
<br/>
 WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br/>
 implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br/>
 of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br/>
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br/>
 appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br/>
 risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br/>

<br/>
 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br/>
 whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br/>
 unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br/>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br/>
 liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br/>
 incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br/>
 result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br/>
 Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br/>
 work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br/>
 other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br/>
 has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br/>

<br/>
 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br/>
 the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br/>
 and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br/>
 or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br/>
 License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br/>
 on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br/>
 of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br/>
 defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br/>
 incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br/>
 of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br/>
